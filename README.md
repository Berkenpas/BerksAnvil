# BerksAnvil
Simple anvil overhaul for Minecraft 1.21.4

The **BerksAnvil** plugin modifies vanilla Minecraft’s anvil behavior by removing the “Too Expensive!” limitation and allowing full customization of enchantments. In vanilla, combining or repairing items in an anvil becomes impossible if the XP cost exceeds 39 levels. This plugin lifts that cap by forcing the cost to never exceed 39, ensuring operations always succeed. Additionally, it allows any enchanted book to apply its enchantments to any item, even if they’re normally incompatible — like putting Knockback II on a stick. Regular enchanting tables remain unchanged, preserving vanilla balance.
